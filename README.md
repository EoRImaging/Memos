## List of memos

1. [Interpreting Discrete Fourier Transforms](PDFs/001_DFT_Interpretation.pdf) - Notes on how to translate between continuous and discrete Fourier transforms, and how to get the units right.
2. [Cosmological Units](PDFs/002_Cosmological_Units.pdf) - Notes on how to convert from the Fourier duals of sky position and frequency to cosmological units. This memo summarizes Hogg 2000 and Morales and Hewitt 2004.
3. [Polarized Cal Cross Phase](PDFs/003_Polarized_Cal_Cross_Phase.pdf) - Documentation of cross phase parameter calculation in FHD. The cross phase parameter is calculated in calibration and defines the overall phase offset between the x- and y-dipoles, corresponding to mixing between Stokes U and V.
4. [Beam Resolution Test](PDFs/004_Beam_Resolution_Test.pdf) - Test on comparing using per frequency beam, which is robust but computationally expensive, and using per half coarse band beam, which is computationally efficient but less reliable, in FHD-eppsilon pipeline.
